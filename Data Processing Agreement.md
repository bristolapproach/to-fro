Data License Agreement


Everybody

Your information (known as data) will be stored securely on a computer system which can only be accessed by specific people and in certain circumstances as explained below. Your data will not be sold on to third parties and will only be shared or made available in strict accordance with this agreement and for the sole purpose of enabling volunteers to provide help for the people who request it.

You have rights over any and all information stored on the system related to yourself (unless it would infringe on another person’s privacy to access it) and thus you may:
view it (or ask for a copy),
ask for it to be ammended (if incorrect or irrelevant),
request for it to be deleted.

To exercise the above rights, please contact one of the Co-ordinators.

The information you receive or have access to through use of this system should only be used for its specified purposes (e.g. to keep in contact and/or complete a specific task), for no longer than needed and you must not keep, make a copy or share it.

If at any point you decide to no longer take part you should inform a Co-ordinator and delete any information you may currently have access to or have received from the system.

You may choose to share and retain contact information with each other, but you must do so strictly outside of this system and with the express permissions from all parties involved.




There are three groups of people in this system:
1. Co-ordinators: volunteers working for the Knowle West Alliance
2. Residents: people who have been referred to the Co-ordinators after they (or a carer/guardian) contacted the council’s We Are Bristol hotline (0800 6940184) or via email (coronavirus@bristol.gov.uk)
3. Helpers: people who have been referred to the Co-ordinators after volunteering via Can Do Bristol (https://candobristol.co.uk).



Helpers

Your information will be received just as you provided it to Can Do Bristol. It may be updated or amended by the Co-ordinators if deemed necessary and with valid reason.

Your information will only be viewable by the Co-ordinators with the sole purposes of making sure that the data is accurate, to make informed decisions on where to direct help, to keep in contact with you and to verify that help is being provided in an expected manner.

You retain rights over your data as explained at the start of this agreement.

For each task you’re approved for, you will have access to personal information about the individual you’re helping (such as name, phone number, address), you should only use this information to arrange and carry out the task as described and for no longer than the duration needed to complete the task.

Whilst you’re registered as a Helper you will have the contact information of one or more Co-ordinators, you should only use this information to keep in contact specifically about your involvement in the system, assigned tasks, or to exercise your personal data rights.

For data you have access to please respect your responsibilities as explained at the start of this agreement.



Residents

Specifically relevant information you provided to the council will have been passed onto the Co-ordinators and entered into this system. The Co-ordinators may ask for further details to aid with providing adequete support.

For each individual task related to you, the Co-ordinator will create a detailed job in the system viewable by other Co-ordinators before, during and after the task is complete.

Before the task is assigned, Helpers with relevant skills or properties (such as access to a car or living in a suitable location) will be able to see a non-identifiable and generic description of your task. If a Helper is assigned to your task, they will temporarily have access to the full details along with your personal contact information. The Helper will only have access to this information to arrange and complete the task and for no longer.

You retain rights over your data as explained at the start of this agreement.

You may acquire personal details (such as phone number or name) of the Co-ordinators or Helpers. This will be for the sole purpose of organising the help that you’ve requested and only for the duration of the task.

For data you have access to please respect your responsibilities as explained at the start of this agreement.

You will have a username and password to access the system. Please use a strong password, keep your login details secure and do not share them with anybody. You can change your password at any time.



Co-ordinators

Your information will be viewable by the other Co-ordinators with the sole purposes of making this system work, through organising and overlooking the Helpers to ensure that they provide adequate support to the Residents. 

Your contact information may at times be shared with Helpers or Residents so that they can keep you informed about new and ongoing tasks as well as giving them the ability to exercise their data rights.

You retain rights over your data as explained at the start of this agreement and although you are able to see, change or delete your own information, you may also request for another Co-ordinator to do so.

You will be able to see and edit all of the information stored in the system including the three groups: Co-ordinators, Residents and Helpers as well as jobs and other relevant information. If anyone requests to see, change or delete the information related to them (where it doesn’t infringe another person’s privacy), then you must do so.

For data you have access to please respect your responsibilities as explained at the start of this agreement.

You will have a username and password to access the system. Please use a strong password, keep your login details secure and do not share them with anybody. You can change your password at any time.
