Hi there,

Thanks so much for offering to help.

You have been approved to help with an action, here are the details:
{{ action_url }}

As ever, please contact the resident ASAP so they know they have a volunteer/buddy and to make the arrangements.  We would recommend you shield your telephone number when doing this.  Please update the details for this action on To/Fro when you have made contact and when you have completed the action (whether one off or ongoing), and put in the time taken to complete.  Once you have done that, please delete all personal details for the resident so you're not holding their data unnecessarily.

If you are having difficulty completing the help offer on time, or if there is something youâ€™d like to flag with a coordinator, please email {{ coordinator_email }}.

Many thanks and best wishes from the KW Support Hub Team
